# Advent of Code (AoC)
A monorepo of my solutions to the [advent of code
events](adventofcode.com). I discovered AoC kinda recently, and have
started solving it asynchronously. For now I am thinking of using a
different language for each year's challenge.

## 2017 - C++17 and Boost
Because I do not have access to a C++20 compiler outside of godbolt.org. Maybe I should use godbolt.org as an IDE.

## 2022 - Julia

# Other Languages and Tools in Consideration
- Zig
- Mojo :fire-emoji:
- Scheme dialect or Lisp dialect. Not sure if the difference will matter for the purpose of AoC.
- Haskell
- asm, most likely x86-64 because that's the one I know
- Jai if I can get get access to the compiler
- Go
